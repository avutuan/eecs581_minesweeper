- `backend` - The directory that stores the backend ([docs](backend/README.md))
- `frontend` - The directory that stores the frontend ([docs](frontend/README.md))
- `REQUIREMENTS.txt` - Python dependencies (FastAPI backend optional)
- `README.md` - this file
- `TODO.md` - a basic todo list for us to keep track of things to do
- `test_minesweeper.py` - file for running tests

## Setup/Running/Building

The backend and frontend must both be running. Setup instructions for both can be found in their respective directories.

## Testing

To run test cases, run the following command in the root directory:
